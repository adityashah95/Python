## About Python
You already know you want to learn Python, and a smarter way to learn Python 3 is to learn by doing. The Python Workshop [The PHP Workshop](https://courses.packtpub.com/courses/php?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838648916&utm_term=PHP&utm_content=The%20PHP%20Workshop) focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can work towards building up your machine learning skills as a data scientist, write scripts that help automate your life and save you time, or even create your own games and desktop applications. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results.
