# Python
Python is among the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s leading the way in machine learning and data science due to its efficiency and speed. 

The Python Workshop introduces you to Python by clearly explaining the key concepts, applying the theory to solve engaging problems, and challenging you to complete practical exercises and activities. This hands-on book covers key topics, including data science, web development, and software development, empowering you with core skills that are in high-demand today. After a practical overview covering the basic syntax, you’ll explore various techniques to overcome common challenges that you might face in your daily work, such as sorting through a list of data using the optimal algorithm or adding visual aids to a dataset using Python. You’ll learn how to write effective programs, code for the web, analyze big data, predict outcomes using machine learning, and automate tasks to become a more effective developer.

By the end of the book, you’ll be able to balance technical and design considerations during the planning stages of large projects and work towards building robust, extensible future-proofed applications in a professional context.

## What you will learn
* Write efficient and concise functions with core Python methods and libraries
* Build classes to address different business needs
* Create visual graphs to communicate key data insights
* Analyze big data and use machine learning to make regression and classification predictions
* Develop web pages and programs with Python tools and packages
* Automate essential tasks using Python scripts in real-time execution
